## workspace concept

In data development and management, the concept of a workspace is similar to a team. A company (ie, a master account) can create multiple workspaces. A workspace is the basic unit for managing tasks, members, and assigning roles and permissions. Collaborative development, operation and maintenance, analysis, etc. in one workspace.

The organization's master account defaults to the organization's workspace administrator user, which is responsible for managing the organization's workspace management console, planning the workspace structure, and creating and deleting workspaces.

Super administrators can click [Create Workspace] on the administrator homepage to create a workspace.

#### Workspace Type:

Workspaces are divided into two categories: project-oriented and department-oriented:

- Project-oriented workspace participation members are vertical structures and can come from different departments;
- Department-Oriented Workspace Participating members are horizontally structured and come from the same department.

In the project-oriented workspace, members of any department can be added;

In a department-oriented workspace, only members of this department can be added.

#### Workspace management:

The default role of a workspace creator is owner, who can delegate the management of the workspace to one or more administrators.

Only the administrator of the workspace can enter the [Workspace Management] module to manage the basic information and permission information of the workspace accordingly.
